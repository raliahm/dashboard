This workspace is a monorepo for a dashboard app with a React (Vite) frontend and a Node.js/Express backend. The backend will later use Postgres for persistent storage. The dashboard features a todo-list, Google Calendar integration, class attendance tracker, homework/task tracker, and a Canvas-style due date overview. The frontend should use a cottagecore/pastel theme with animated, interactive UI elements.
